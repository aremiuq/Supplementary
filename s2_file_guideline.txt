In this document, the meaning of each column in each sheet is explained

overview:
  - Drug = Drug name
  - Outcome = Adverse event
  - fda_n = Number of reports retrieved by the FDA API containing the drug and the outcome.
  - n = Number of reports retrieved after the prepossessing.
  - openvigil_n = Number of reports retrieved by OpenVigil 2 web service.
  - ground_truth = Drug-AE relationships according OMOP gold standard, used as benchmark. 
  - openvigil_signal = Signal detected by OpenVigil 2?
  - x_squared_cut_off = Signal detected by chi squared test?
  - fisher_cut_off = Signal detected by fisher's exact test?
  - prr_cut_off = Signal detected by PRR?
  - ror_cut_off = Signal detected by ROR?
  - bcpnn_cut_off = Signal detected by BCPNN?
  - gps_cut_off = Signal detected by GPS?
  - mcem_cut_off = Signal detected by MCEM?

all_data:
  - Drug = Drug name
  - Outcome = Adverse event
  - PMID = Pubmed identifier, drug-AE relationships without PMID comes from conference
  - reference_title = paper or conference title 
  - level_of_evidence = level of evidence associated to the drug-AE relationship in the paper. A = Significant signal, B = Not clear signal, C = Negative signal. The cases with a B evidence are not considered in metapredictor and reliability calculations. 
  - reference = Translation of level_of_evidence letters to TRUE, FALSE or NA
  - fda_n = Number of reports retrieved by the FDA API containing the drug and the outcome.
  - n = Number of reports retrieved after the prepossessing.
  - openvigil_n = Number of reports retrieved by OpenVigil 2 web service.
  - x_squared_cut_off = Signal detected by chi squared test?
  - x_squared = Chi squared test result
  - x_squared_p_value = Chi squared test p-value result
  - fisher_cut_off = Signal detected by fisher's exact test?
  - fisher_ROR = ROR obtained by fisher's exact test
  - fisher_p_value = Fisher's exact test p-value result
  - prr_cut_off = Signal detected by PRR?
  - prr = PRR value 
  - prr_lb95 = PRR lower bound at 95% of confidence 
  - ror_cut_off = Signal detected by ROR?
  - ror = ROR value 
  - ror_lb95 = ROR lower bound at 95% of confidence 
  - bcpnn_cut_off = Signal detected by BCPNN?
  - bcpnn_IC0025 = IC lower bound at 95% of confidence
  - bcpnn_OBSvsEXP = BCPNN observed vs expected value
  - gps_cut_off = Signal detected by GPS?
  - gps_lb95 = GPS lower bound at 95% of confidence 
  - mcem_cut_off = Signal detected by MCEM?
  - mcem_Q_0.05 = MCEM lower bound at 95% of confidence
  - mcem_OBSvsEXP = MCEM observed vs expected value
  - openvigil_signal = Signal detected by OpenVigil 2?

reliability:
  These sheet shows the sensitivity and specificity obtained by each method at their optimal threshold

jury_vote/red_flag/unanimous_consensus:
  - methods = method/s used in the combination
  - n_qualifiers = number of methods used in the combination
  - sn = Sensitivity
  - sp = Specificity
  - prec = Precision
  - youden_J = Informdeness
  - f0.5 = F score at 0.5
  - f1 = F score at 1
  - f2 = F score at 2
  - MCC = Matthews correlation coefficient
  - TP = True positives
  - TN = True negatives
  - FP = False positives
  - FN = False negatives
